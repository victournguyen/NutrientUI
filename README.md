# Nutrient UI
A UI for visualizing the CORGIS [ingredients](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/ingredients/) data set.

This R application uses [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [shiny.fluent](https://appsilon.github.io/shiny.fluent/), which integrates Microsoft's Fluent UI into Shiny, to display a reactive plot with multiple options, ranging from variable selection to color input. Other libraries used include tidyverse and Plotly.

**NOTE:** The word "category" refers to the `Category.Broad` column derived from the original `Category` column.
